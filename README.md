# BuckeyeJS CFP

For years, Buckeye Nation has played host to C#, Java, Python, Mobile and UX conferences. It's time we had a conference built by JavaScript developers for JavaScript developers so we can explore the future of the language in all its bountiful glory.

BuckeyeJS 2015 will be held on Saturday, October 24, 2015 in capital city Columbus, OH. This year's CFP closes on September 18, 2015.


# Speaking @ BuckeyeJS

Call for proposals for all speakers at BuckeyeJS is now open. All JavaScript developers are welcome, even those with the misfortune of residing in that state up north. 

Working with front-end frameworks, we want to hear from you. Building the next great designer language that compiles to JavaScript, we want to hear from you. Working with the latest ES6 JavaScript features, we want to hear from you. Working with anything hardware - microcontrollers that run JavaScript, drones that run JavaScript, refrigerators that run JavaScript, cars that run JavaScript, we want to hear from you. You get the idea...

EVERYTHING JavaScript.


# What makes a great talk

Don't just talk about a technology, tell the story of what you did with that technology. Too many conferences are all about the 101 intro talk, this is not one of those conferences. Some approaches or innovations are understandably new, so submit what is in your heart. But, understand we are looking for intermediate to advanced talks. 

Most developers at BuckeyeJS are seasoned professionals, so we want them to learn things they can take back to improve their workflows. Give them something to think about.


# Submit a talk

To submit your talk, create an issue in this repository. Be as creative as you like. At the minimum, we expect to see the following categories of information.

- Topic of Talk

- Full Summary of Talk

- Brief Summary of Talk (600 characters)

- Speaker Full Name, Job Title, Email, Website, Twitter, Gravatar Link (Avatar or Real Photo, it's up to you)


# Talk format

Talks are 50 minutes. Please bake into your talk 5-7 minutes for Q&A.

BuckeyeJS is designed for advanced developers. Talks should target intermediate to advanced skill levels.
